# Summary
This notebook visualizes ball flight trajectories for driver distances on the PGA tour. Trajectories are reversed engineered based on the min, max, and 25th/50th/75th percentiles and some assumptions like launch angle, air density, and drag coefficient of a golf ball.

## Driving Distance Definition
The average number of yards per measured drive. These drives are measured on two holes per round. Care is taken to select two holes which face in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Drives are measured to the point at which they come to rest regardless of whether they are in the fairway or not. (101)
